# random-forest-for-exoplanets

*This was originally a project for CS301 that I'm continuing outside of class.*

This is a low-level random forest implementation designed to classify star lightcurves in order to detect exoplanets.
At the moment, it's rather makeshift (like *really* makeshift), but I plan to overhaul it and write it properly.
